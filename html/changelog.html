		<li class="rscadd">I'm still working on adding in the engineers proper, they'll be in soon.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Landmines are in. They spawn randomly in the wasteland and can be disarmed with good wirecutters if you have good engineering skill.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Everyone now spawns with "handful" boxes. These replace the old boxes. Clicking on them when they're in your pocket or inactive hand will give you a handful of rifle or shotgun ammo depending on the box.</li>
		<li class="rscadd"> captains now have verbs to better command their teams.</li>
		<li class="rscadd"> captain deaths now give his team a bad mood.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Braindead people no longer count towards objective points.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Dead people no longer count towards objective points.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Added primary hand. You can set it in the player creation. Doing stuff with your non primary hand gives you a debuff on rolls.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Grenades can finally pass over dirt barricades.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">You can now dig your own dirt cover with a shovel. RMB on the dirt to build one. Might take a bit. RMB on dirt cover to dismantle it.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Second z-level added to forts.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Opposite factions can no longer enter each other's bases and spawn kill.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Forts redesigned to have less empty space. Bartender removed.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Fortresses; home bases for the teams that also host some RP jobs such as practitioner, bartender, and chef</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Made job selection pretty.</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Firing your rifle one handed is no longer more accurate than firing with both hands. Thanks Bay.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Added puddle generation. Nicer skin.dmf that shows your name and has no more white space (@Janey  you can be happy now). More readable chat. Some non combat roles if you just wanna sit around and RP and not actually shoot somebody (like a dork lol).</li>
		<li class="bugfix">Finally for once in everyone's fucking life I have finally fucking fixed accuracy for guns.</li>
		<li class="rscdel">I made a changelog for the warfare shit. Old changelog stands as a testament to what has been done in the past.</li>
